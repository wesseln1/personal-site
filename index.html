            <p>
              Coming from Michigan you wouldn't expect Nashvilles best tour
              guide to be me. I currently drive for Joyride as well as a junior
              software developer at Nashville Software School. What makes me
              enjoy software development is seeing the finished product of what
              you built after. Being able to build and see these amazing things
              we can build drives me to be the best dev i can be. I was raised
              to be a hard worker and have always strive to do my best. Working
              for wolverine world wide really helped teach me leadership skills
              as well as the ability to make the right decisions when needed.
              I'm a quick learner and I don't give up, I find a way to get it
              done. I can be reached at nwessel429@gmail.com

                months prior to becoming a tour guide.

              <p>
                Managing a Distillery was as much fun as it sounds. I loved this
                job, but just like all great things, it had to come to an end.
                After over a year of helping Manage our Nashville store, i began
                chasing my software development dream once i left for Joyride.
                From customer service to making sure supplies were kept stocked,
                i put my joy and passion into Tennessee Legends. Although i may
                miss it, i am happy to be moving foward into software field.
